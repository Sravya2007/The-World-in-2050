                They can propel passengers or cargo at speeds of over 1000 km/h. The Hyperloop system consists of sealed and partially evacuated tubes, connecting mobility hubs in large metropolitan areas, and pressurized vehicles, 
                usually called pods, which can move at very high speeds, thanks to contactless levitation and propulsion systems as well as to the low aerodynamic drag.</p>
